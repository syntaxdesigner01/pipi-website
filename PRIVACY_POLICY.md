**Last Updated:** [Current Date]

## Introduction

Pipi ("we," "us," or "our") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard your information when you use our Chrome extension, Pipi.

## Information We Collect

- **Project/Group Names:** The names of the folders or projects you create to organize your bookmarks.
- **Usage Data:** Preferences and settings you configure within the extension.

**We do not collect personal identification information (PII)** such as your name, email address, or physical address.

## How We Use Your Information

We use the information we collect solely for the purpose of providing the extension's functionality:

- To save and retrieve your bookmarks.
- To organize bookmarks into the research project groups you define.
- To display your saved content within the extension interface.

## Data Storage and Security

- **Local Storage:** All data generated by Pipi (bookmarks, groups, settings) is stored locally on your device using the Chrome Storage API.

- **Tabs:** Used to access the URL and title of the active tab when you initiate a "save" action, and to open your saved bookmarks.
- **Alarms:** Used to schedule internal background tasks to maintain extension performance.
- **Notifications:** Used to provide visual feedback, such as confirming a bookmark has been successfully saved.
- **Offscreen:** Used to perform background processing (such as data handling) without opening a visible window.
- **Host Permissions (All URLs):** Required to interact with the websites you visit, enabling the extension to capture the URL and title for bookmarking purposes from any page.
